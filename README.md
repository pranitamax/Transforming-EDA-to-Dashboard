# Transforming-EDA-to-Dashboard
The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb data using Tableau, with the aim of gaining insights into pricing trends, property characteristics, and user behavior in the Airbnb ecosystem. By summarizing the project in this way, we can effectively communicate the objectives, methods, findings, and visualizations of your Airbnb analysis in Tableau Dashboard to stakeholders and other interested parties.

## Problem Statement
In the context of Airbnb operations, how can the utilisation of Tableau facilitate a comprehensive comparative examination between Chicago and New Orleans, two diverse urban environments? This inquiry seeks to leverage Tableau's visual analytics capabilities to uncover and illustrate the shared attributes, disparities, and distinctive patterns inherent to Airbnb's presence in these cities, thus elevating the depth and insightfulness of the study.

## Business Objective
Create Stunning Tableau Dashboard from the same dataset on which EDA was performed for the capstone project. Which will give us meaningful insights

## conclusion
In conclusion, the Airbnb Analysis Tableau Project has successfully provided a comprehensive and visually engaging analysis of Airbnb's rental listings and user interactions. Through Tableau's data visualization capabilities, we have gained valuable insights into property occupancy rates, pricing trends, and user reviews. These insights empower Airbnb hosts and management to make data-driven decisions, improving property listings, optimizing pricing strategies, and enhancing customer engagement. By delving into data patterns, location preferences, and user demographics, this project has contributed to improving the overall Airbnb experience for hosts and guests alike. It underscores the significance of data analysis and visualization in the hospitality industry for informed decision-making and continued growth.
