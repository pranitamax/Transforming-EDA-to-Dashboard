# Transforming-EDA-to-Dashboard
The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb data using Tableau, with the aim of gaining insights into pricing trends, property characteristics, and user behavior in the Airbnb ecosystem. By summarizing the project in this way, we can effectively communicate the objectives, methods, findings, and visualizations of your Airbnb analysis in Tableau Dashboard to stakeholders and other interested parties.

## Problem Statement
In the context of Airbnb operations, how can the utilisation of Tableau facilitate a comprehensive comparative examination between Chicago and New Orleans, two diverse urban environments? This inquiry seeks to leverage Tableau's visual analytics capabilities to uncover and illustrate the shared attributes, disparities, and distinctive patterns inherent to Airbnb's presence in these cities, thus elevating the depth and insightfulness of the study.

## Business Objective
Create Stunning Tableau Dashboard from the same dataset on which EDA was performed for the capstone project. Which will give us meaningful insights
